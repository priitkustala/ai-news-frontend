# ai-news frontend

Canonical rule file of this repository. `CLAUDE.md` only imports it. Read it before any
work here. Changes to this file are reviewed in a pull request like code.

## What This Repository Is

The iPhone app of ai-news: the owner reads AI-specific news in it. It talks to the backend only through the backend's published interface. Backend services are not in this repository; they live in `ai-news-backend`.

- Language/runtime: PENDING (set in the Brief stage from the LOCKED specification)
- Frameworks: PENDING (same)
- Deployment: PENDING (the iPhone delivery path is decided in the specification)
- Owning team: ai-news; team context: `ai-news-team-context`

## Build, Test, Run

PENDING. No stack is chosen yet, so no command is listed and none may be assumed. The
first story of the Development pillar fills this table with exact commands (install,
build, unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, lint and format, run locally,
run one test) and the Done When list below. Until then no feature work starts here.

## Protected Areas

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/`, `CODEOWNERS`: change only in a pull request
  whose purpose is that change; the owner reviews it.
- CI configuration, dependency lockfiles and anything holding configuration of
  secrets: stop and ask before changing.
- Secrets, tokens and keys never enter this repository, a prompt or memory.

## Local Conventions

- One story per session. Work starts from an approved story (issue) and a task brief
  (`docs/task-brief.md`).
- A bug or side issue found on the way is staged as a separate proposed item for the
  owner; the story in hand is not widened.
- Branch per story; changes reach `main` only through a pull request the owner
  reviews and merges. No agent merges, releases or deploys.
- Every pull request fills `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, and carries the label
  `ai-assisted` when any part was produced by an agent.
- Tests use seeded test data only, never real personal data.

## How to Verify: Done When

PENDING with the Build, Test, Run table. Until it is filled, "done" cannot be claimed
for any change other than documentation.

## Starting a Session Here

This repository is part of the ai-news project and is meant to be checked out inside
the project folder, next to `ai-news-team-context/`.

1. Read this file.
2. Read the team's front door, `../ai-news-team-context/AGENTS.md`, and load the
   shared context: from the project folder run `python scripts/session-context.py --text`
   (handoff, operating contract, notes).
3. Inside the dev container only this repository is mounted writable. The team
   context is mounted read-only at `/workspaces/ai-news-team-context` and the
   testing skill at `/workspaces/.skills/outside-in-e2e-testing`; read the front
   door and `rules/regression-contract.md` from there.
4. If the team context cannot be read at all (a clone on its own), stop and say
   so. Do not start work that the missing rules govern.

## Quality Assurance

- The team's testing rules: `../ai-news-team-context/rules/regression-contract.md`.
- Outside-in scenarios live in `e2e/` and cover the app's screens at iPhone size (`@surface-app`, project `iphone`). Run them with the
  shared skill `outside-in-e2e-testing` (preflight, start on localhost, tagged run,
  report by journey).
- Scenarios are written from a story's acceptance criteria before implementation and
  must first fail on their assertion.
- How to start, seed and sign in locally: `e2e/README.md`. PENDING until the stack is
  chosen; nobody guesses these commands.

## Autonomous Runs: the Sandbox

- Unattended or auto-accept work runs only inside this repository's dev container:
  run `sandbox` from this folder in Git Bash. On the host, commands and file changes
  are reviewed before they run.
- `.devcontainer/` belongs to this repository. The egress allowlist is the
  `x-extra-allowed-domains` anchor in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` and changes
  only through a reviewed diff. Additions so far: `auth.openai.com`, `chatgpt.com`, `api.openai.com` (the second-vendor agent); `cdn.playwright.dev`, `playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com` (browser builds for the scenarios).
- Inside the box, use git there and not on the host checkout. No production
  credentials enter the box.
- Identities: attended sessions may use the owner's own sign-in. Unattended runs
  need scoped tokens and `AGENT_REQUIRE_AUTH=1`, so the boot check refuses a bad
  credential; which tokens, and whether the owner's personal identity is ever
  acceptable unattended, is an open owner decision (the template's boot check only
  warns about a personal identity).
- `sandbox` starts Claude Code in the box. Starting the Codex generator in the box
  is not yet validated; see the workspace's `runs/ai-news-app/harness.md`, section 7.

## Where the Rest Lives

- Team domain, decisions, specifications and memory: `ai-news-team-context` (bound by
  `.memspec.yaml` in this repository).
- The operating contract, the lifecycle and the roles: the ai-news workspace's
  contract record in that store.
- The standard this repository follows: the Agentic SDLC guidance kept in the ai-news
  workspace under `inputs/agentic-sdlc-guidance/` (not redistributed here).
